# ValidatorGPT-Chatbot

This project aims to develop a chatbot powered by a fine-tuned GPT model to assist users with questions about Polygon, Bor, Heimdall, runbooks, playbooks, and other related topics in the validator ecosystem.

## To-Do List

1. **Gather and preprocess data**
   - Collect and organize the knowledge base from various resources
   - Preprocess the data by cleaning it, removing irrelevant content, and formatting it consistently

2. **Fine-tune the language model**
   - Train ChatGPT using the preprocessed data
   - Fine-tune the model to understand the context and specific terminology related to the knowledge base

3. **Develop the chatbot**
   - Create a chatbot interface that interacts with the fine-tuned ValidatorGPT model
   - Integrate the chatbot into a web application, messaging platform, or other communication channels

4. **Test and iterate**
   - Test the chatbot with real users and gather feedback
   - Refine the model and retrain it using an updated dataset that addresses identified issues

5. **Monitor and maintain**
   - Regularly monitor the chatbot's performance and update the knowledge base as needed
   - Retrain the model to ensure it remains up-to-date and accurate

## Training Data Resources

Here is a list of resources to be used as the training set for the ValidatorGPT model:

- [Polygon POS](https://polygon.technology/polygon-pos)
- [New to Polygon](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/home/new-to-polygon/)
- [Technical Requirements](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/operate/technical-requirements)
- [Validator Index](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/maintain/validate/validator-index/)
- [Polygon Improvement Proposals (PIPs)](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/maintain/govern/pips/)
- [Polygon Architecture](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/pos/polygon-architecture/)
- [General FAQ](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/faq/general-faq/)
- [Whitepaper](https://github.com/maticnetwork/whitepaper/)
- [Blog Posts](https://polygon.technology/blog/)
- [Polygon Forum](https://forum.polygon.technology/)

### Data Collection Strategy

One approach to collecting data from the listed resources is to use a web scraper or crawler to extract the relevant content. The scrapy library in Python is a powerful and flexible tool for web scraping. We can create a custom scraper that extracts information from the URLs listed above and saves the content in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV.

For the Polygon Forum, we can focus on crawling categories such as Polygon POS Updates, Polygon Testnets, and Polygon Improvement Proposals. I need to check Polygon website's robots.txt file and request rate limits to avoid overwhelming the server.

Alternatively, we can use an API, if available, to access the data more efficiently and reliably. For example, the forum might have an API that allows us to fetch data in a structured format, making it easier to process and integrate into our dataset.
